  # ScholarSearch

  It is a complete `MERN` stack app developed during a 24 hour Hackathon
  
  As a member of Team Ciphers, my primary contribution to this project was focused on the overall user interface (UI) design. I worked on creating visually appealing      and user-friendly pages, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience. Additionally, I played a role in developing several React pages and implementing routing to     enhance the project's functionality. I'm proud to have been a part of this collaborative effort.
